        <p class="about-text"><strong>I'm a Software Developer & Photographer @ Richardson Media House</strong> based in Atlanta, Georgia. I have extensive experience prototyping, designing, developing, and optimizing applications and UIs for the Web. I enjoy creating software that is both lightweight and functional, while going above and beyond to bring quality code that fulfills its intended use.</p>
        <p class="about-text">I bring almost a decade of development experience, over a decade of experience building and maintaining all types of computers, as well as a penchant for the details of minimalist design. Ultimately, I enjoy learning about and using different technology and languages to keep current in the industry and always know what tech is good for a specific use-case.</p>
        <p class="about-text"><strong>When I'm not building an application or computer,</strong> I'm probably hanging out with my son, Luca, or photographing something.</p>
